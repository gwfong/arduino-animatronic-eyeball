# arduino-animatronic-eyeball
This is the Arduino code for the [Huge Arduino Animatronic LED Eyeball](http://www.instructables.com/id/Huge-Arduino-Animatronic-LED-Eyeball/) that I built for Halloween a couple of years ago. The eyeball moved based on what 2 ultrasonic sensors picked up. It was designed to "look at you" based on where you are standing. This project was actually just a subpart of an even bigger project called the [Candy Delivery Monster](http://www.instructables.com/id/Candy-Delivery-Monster/) which delivered candy to kids. And that project was just a subpart of an even bigger system of projects created by many makers that together created a Rube Goldberg system which took canned food donations from kids and resulted with them receiving candy at the end.
